# similarity-search-on-chroma-vector-db
implementing text similarity search using embeddings in Chroma DB, a database system designed for managing and querying text data efficiently.
Chroma DB integration: The code demonstrates the integration of Chroma DB with Python for similarity search and embeddings. The code imports necessary modules from Chroma DB, creates a client instance, and configures the embedding function using SentenceTransformers.

Data handling: The code creates a collection named "my_grocery_collection" within the Chroma DB client. The code defines sample text documents related to grocery items and adds these text documents to this collection along with their corresponding IDs and metadata. The SentenceTransformer embedding function generates embeddings for the text documents automatically when they are added to the collection.

Similarity search: The code defines a function named "perform_similarity_search" to run a similarity search based on a specified query term. In this case, the code specifies the query term "apple" to retrieve the top three similar text documents from the collection. The function itera
